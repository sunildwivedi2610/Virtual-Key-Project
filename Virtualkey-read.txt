If user will enter wrong file name it will display the File not found.
 
Same for the searching option, select option 3, it will ask the name of file which you want to search, if file available in the directory it will display file found otherwise it will show file not found.

Language and IDE Used:
                        For developing Virtual Key app I have used Java Programming language to develop app.
Eclipse IDE used for coding. 
For developing Virtual Key I have used core Java concept, Loops, Collections, Interface, Method Overloading Method Overriding, to display options used ArrayList also used the Java File Input/Output stream for the all file operation, String and Java Exception Handeling. 
              For sorting I have used the Collection.sort method to sort the files in ascending order.
